# Bash Scripting

Bash Script is incorporated to automate command sequences which are repetitive in nature. Scripting is a way by which one can alleviate this necessity by automating these command sequences in order to make one’s life at the shell easier and more productive. In most organizations, Bash scripting is incorporated in one way or another to automate processes.

Bash scripts are stored in simple text files containing lines with commands that get executed in sequence, one after the other. These files typically have the `.sh` extension (although not required and some argue that there should be no extension at all, since it can be confused with Sh Shell)
