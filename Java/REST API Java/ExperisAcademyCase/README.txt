# Humans vs Zombies (2022)
This project was the "real life" case given as the final project at Experis Academy.
It includes:
- Login through Keycloak (a seperate project than the one in here)
- Hibernate (JPA implementation)
- Postgres database
- Docker
- RESTful API


A lot of setup is done in the application.properties file

In addition there are other config files (.java) in the config folder (in HvsZ project)
