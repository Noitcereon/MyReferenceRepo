# Open Source Standards

This file will document standards I have encountered, so I have a reference when I look for a solution to a specific problem, e.g. logging between systems.

It will not go into any detail, but will: name the standard, give a brief description and provide a link to more information.

## Standards

- [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/): OpenTelemetry is a collection of APIs, SDKs, and tools. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your softwareâ€™s performance and behavior.
  * An example of software implementing OpenTelemetry: https://fluentbit.io/opentelemetry/
