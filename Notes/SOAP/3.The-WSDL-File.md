# The WSDL File

WSDL stands for `Web Service Definition Language`. WSDL is pronounced as
"Wisdel". Imagine 'Wisdom' and 'Dell' combined.

```
- WSDL stands for Web Services Description Language
- WSDL is used to describe web services
- WSDL is written in XML
- WSDL is a W3C recommendation from 26. June 2007
- It is most often used in combination with SOAP.

To properly understand the WSDL file you need to understand XML and XML namespaces thoroughly.

You can get all the information you need from [w3schools's XML documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp)

If you're too impatient to read it all, at least look at [XML Namespaces](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_namespaces.asp).

## Structure 

A WSDL file consists of 4 elements:

| Element  | Description                                                                |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| types    | Defines the (XML Schema) data types used by the web service                |
| message  | Defines the data elements for each operation                               |
| portType | Describes the operations that can be performed and the messages involved.  |
| binding  | Defines the protocol and data format for each port type                    |

```
<definitions>

    <types>
      data type definitions........
    </types>
    
    <message>
      definition of the data being communicated....
    </message>
    
    <portType>
      set of operations......
    </portType>
    
    <binding>
      protocol and data format specification....
    </binding>

</definitions> 
```
In addition, there are 4 types of operations, where `request-response` is the most common:

|       Type       |                             Definition                              |
|:----------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     One-way      | The operation can receive a message but will not return a response  |
| Request-response |   The operation can receive a request and will return a response    |
| Solicit-response |    The operation can send a request and will wait for a response    |
|   Notification   |  The operation can send a message but will not wait for a response  |


Example of a SOAP WSDL with request-response Operation:

```
<message name="getTermRequest">
  <part name="term" type="xs:string"/>
</message>

<message name="getTermResponse">
  <part name="value" type="xs:string"/>
</message>

<portType name="glossaryTerms">
  <operation name="getTerm">
    <input message="getTermRequest"/>
    <output message="getTermResponse"/>
  </operation>
</portType>

<binding type="glossaryTerms" name="b1">
   <soap:binding style="document"
   transport="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http" />
   <operation>
     <soap:operation soapAction="http://example.com/getTerm"/>
     <input><soap:body use="literal"/></input>
     <output><soap:body use="literal"/></output>
  </operation>
</binding> 
```

The most confusing part is the binding.

The binding element has two attributes - name and type.

The name attribute (you can use any name you want) defines the name of the binding, and the type attribute points to the port for the binding, in this case the "glossaryTerms" port.

The soap:binding element has two attributes - style and transport.

The style attribute can be "rpc" or "document". In this case we use document. The transport attribute defines the SOAP protocol to use. In this case we use HTTP.

The operation element defines each operation that the portType exposes.

For each operation the corresponding SOAP action has to be defined. You must also specify how the input and output are encoded. In this case we use "literal"
