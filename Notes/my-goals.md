# My Goals

This file contains the goals I aspire to achieve as a developer. The purpose of it is to have something to work towards and thereby
focus my learning efforts. The intended audience is only myself, but if you see this and would like to ask me about it, feel free to reach out.

I will split this document in 2 sections: 
1. Things I Want to Be Able to Do
2. Things I Need to Achieve What I Want

## Things I Want To Be Able to Do
